## General Info

The aim of this project is to **reproduce the game Core War** whit **this virtual machin**.

**SOME INFORMATION:**

- **The goal of the game** is to create a warrior that eliminates all other opponent warriors by causing them to execute incorrect instructions. 

- **The game proceeds in cycles**, in each cycle, every warrior executes an instruction from their current position in the core. 

- A **warrior is eliminated** if it **executes** an instruction that **triggers an error** or if he doesn't execute a **live command** (such as referencing a non-existent memory slot) or if it is disabled by another warrior by overwriting its instructions.

- **The Arena (Core)**: Imagine a circular memory space called the "core," consisting of memory slots. Each memory slot can hold a program instruction.
